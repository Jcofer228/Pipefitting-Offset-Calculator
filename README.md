# Pipefitting-Offset-Calculator
This java program calculates the Offset, Run, Travel, and Angle values of a standard pipe offset given two input values. 
The program will ask you to input OFFSET first, then RUN, then ANGLE.
When prompted to input values, input them without symbols. 
If you do not know the value, input the value as "0", the program will calculate it for you, given you input the other two values. 
If you input a value for OFFSET and RUN, the program will ignore any value in the ANGLE input and will calulate the angle based on the OFFSET and RUN values. 
The program will ALWAYS assume your OFFSET and RUN values are correct and will re-calculate your ANGLE value based on them. 
If you leave an input blank, the program will prompt you for another input, if you do not know the input, then use "0".
